# Terminology and Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Protocol Overview

This document introduces a mapping of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to the QUIC transport
protocol. QUIC supports two transport methods: reliable streams and unreliable datagrams
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, {{QUIC-DATAGRAM}}. RTP over QUIC uses the unreliable datagrams to transport
real-time data.

{{!RFC3550}} specifies that RTP sessions need to be transmitted on different transport addresses to
allow multiplexing between them. RTP over QUIC uses a different approach, in order to leverage the
advantages of QUIC connections without managing a separate QUIC connection per RTP session. QUIC
does not provide multiplexing between different flows on datagrams, but recommends the use of
variable-length integers to prepend each datagram with a unique flow identifier for multiplexing
flows. RTP over QUIC uses a flow identifier as a replacement for network address and port number, to
multiplex many RTP sessions over the same QUIC connection.

A congestion controller can be plugged in, to adapt the media bitrate to the available bandwidth.
This document does not mandate any congestion control algorithm, some examples include
Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) {{!RFC8698}} and Self- Clocked Rate Adaptation for
Multimedia (SCReAM) {{!RFC8298}}. These congestion control algorithms require some feedback about
the performance of the network in order to calculate target bitrates. Traditionally this feedback is
generated at the receiver and sent back to the sender via RTCP. Since QUIC also collects some
metrics about the networks performance, these metrics can be used to generate the required feedback
at the sender-side and provide it to the congestion controller, to avoid the additional overhead of
the RTCP stream.

> **TODO:** Should the congestion controller work independently from the congestion
> controller used in QUIC, because the QUIC connection can simultaneously be used for other data
> streams, that need to be congestion controlled, too?

# Local Interfaces

RTP over QUIC requires different components like QUIC implementations, congestion controllers and
media encoders to work together. The interfaces of these components have to fulfill certain
requirements which are described in this section.

## QUIC Interface

If the used QUIC implementation is not directly incorporated into the RTP over QUIC mapping
implementation, it has to fulfill the following interface requirements. The QUIC implementation MUST
support QUICs unreliable datagrams and it MUST provide a way to signal acknowledgements or losses of
datagrams to the application. Since datagram frames cannot be fragmented, the QUIC implementation
MUST provide a way to query the maximum datagram size, so that an application can create RTP packets
that always fit into a datagram.

Additionally, a QUIC implementation MUST expose the recorded RTT statistics as described in
{{Section 5 of QUIC-RECOVERY}} to the application. These statistics include the minium observed RTT
over a period of time (min_rtt), exponentially-weighted moving average (smoothed_rtt) and the mean
deviation (rttvar). These values are necessary to perform congestion control as explained in
{{cc-interface}}.

{{Section 7.1 of QUIC-RECOVERY}} also specifies how QUIC treats ECN marks if ECN is supported by the
network path. If ECN counts can be exported from a QUIC implementation, these may be used to improve
congestion control, too.

## Congestion Controller Interface {#cc-interface}

There are different congestion control algorithms proposed by RMCAT to implement application layer
congestion control for real-time communications. To estimate the currently available bandwidth,
these algorithms keep track of the sent packets and typically require a list of received packets
together with the timestamps at which they were received by a receiver. The bandwidth estimation can
then be used to decide, whether the media encoder can be configured to produce output at a higher or
lower rate.

A congestion controller used for RTP over QUIC should be able to compute an adequate bandwidth
estimation using the following inputs:

* A current timestamp
* A list of packets that were acknowledged by the receiver
* For each acknowledged packet, a delay between the sent- and receive-timestamps of the packet
* Minimum and average RTT estimations and the RTT variation as calculated by QUIC {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}
* Optionally ECN marks may be used, if supported by the network and exposed by the QUIC
  implementation.

A congestion controller MUST expose a target bitrate to which the encoder should be configured and
may additionally provide a pacing mechanism.

## Codec Interface {#encoder-interface}

An application is expected to adapt the media bitrate to the observed available bandwidth by setting
the media encoder to the target bitrate that is computed by the congestion controller. Thus, the
media encoder needs to offer a way to update the target bitrate accordingly. An implementation can
either expose the most recent bitrate estimation produced by the congestion controller, or directly
take a callback to update the encoder bitrate which is called whenever the congestion controller
updates its target bitrate.

# Packet Format {#packet-format}


## Encoding: Binary representation

All packets are sent as datagrams with the following format:

~~~
Datagram Payload {
  Flow Identifier (i),
  RTP/RTCP Packet (..)
}
~~~
{: #fig-datagram-payload title="Datagram Payload Format"}

For multiplexing streams on the same QUIC connection, each RTP packet is prefixed with a flow
identifier. This flow identifier serves as a replacement for using different transport addresses per
stream. A flow identifier is a QUIC variable length integer which must be unique per stream.

## "How to transport / encapsulate"

# Protocol Operation {#protocol-operation}

This section describes how senders and receivers can exchange RTP packets using QUIC. While the
receiver side is very simple, the sender side has to keep track of sent packets and corresponding
acknowledgements to implement congestion control.

RTP/RTCP packets that are submitted to an RTP over QUIC implementation are buffered in a queue. The
congestion controller defines the rate at which the next packet is dequeued and sent over the QUIC
connection. Before a packet is sent, it is prefixed with the flow identifier described in
{{packet-format}} and encapsulated in a QUIC datagram.

The implementation has to keep track of sent packets in order to build the feedback for a congestion
controller described in {{cc-interface}}. Each sent packet is mapped to the datagram in which it was
sent over QUIC. When the QUIC implementation signals an acknowledgement for a specific datagram, the
packet that was sent in this datagram is marked as received. Together with the received mark, an
estimation of the delay at which the packet was received by the peer can be stored. Assuming the RTT
is divided equally between the link from the sender to the receiver and the link back to the sender,
this estimation can be calculated using the RTT exposed by QUIC divided by two.

Depending on the requirements of the used congestion controll algorithm, a feedback report including
the information described in {{cc-interface}} can then be generated and passed to the congestion
controller. The feedback report can be passed to the congestion controller at a frequency
specified by the used algorithm.

The congestion controller regularly outputs a target bitrate, which is forwarded to the encoder
using the interface described in {{encoder-interface}}.

{: #fig-send-flow title="RTP over QUIC send flow"}

On receiving a datagram, a RTP over QUIC implementation strips off and parses the flow identifier to
identify the stream to which the received RTP packet belongs. The remaining content of the datagram
is then passed to the RTP session which was assigned the given flow identifier.

# SDP Signalling

> **TODO:** Describe how SDP can be used to setup session, e.g. assign flow IDs.

> **TODO:** How to deal with different applications using Datagrams on the same QUIC connection?

# Used RTP/RTCP packet types

Any RTP packet can be sent over QUIC and no RTCP packets are used by default. Since QUIC already
includes some features which are usually implemented by certain RTCP messages, RTP over QUIC
implementations should not need to implement the following RTCP messages:

* PT=205, FMT=1, Name=Generic NACK: Provides Negative Acknowledgements {{!RFC4585}}. Acknowledgement
  and loss notifications are already provided by the QUIC connection.
* PT=205, FMT=8, Name=RTCP-ECN-FB: Provides RTCP ECN Feedback {{!RFC6679}}. If supported, ECN
  may directly be exposed by the used QUIC implementation.
* PT=205, FMT=11, Name=CCFB: RTP Congestion Control Feedback which contains receive marks,
  timestamps and ECN notifications for each received packet {{!RFC8888}}. This can be inferred from
  QUIC as described in {{protocol-operation}}.
* PT=210, FMT=all, Name=Token, {{!RFC6284}} specifies a way to dynamically assign ports for RTP
  receivers. Since QUIC connections manage ports on their own, this is not required for RTP over
  QUIC.

# Enhancements

The RTT measured by QUIC may not be very precise because it can be influenced by delayed ACKs. An
alternative the RTT is to explicitly measure a one way delay. {{QUIC-TS}} suggests an extension for
QUIC to implement one way delay measurements using a timestamp carried in a special QUIC frame. The
new frame carries the time at which a packet was sent. This timestamp can be used by the receiver to
estimate a one way delay as the difference between the time at which a packet was received and the
timestamp in the received packet. The one way delay can then be used as a replacement for the
receive time estimation derived from the RTT as described in {{protocol-operation}}.

> **TODO:** Using OWD in ACKS tells a sender the OWD from receiver to sender, but we might be more
> interested in OWD from sender to receiver so maybe we need to specify some RTCP feedback in the
> previous section?
